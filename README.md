# RadioSkyGUIde

This project aims to create an interface for viewing the radio sky from any location on Earth, with a focus on the Allen Telescope Array. 

As of now, you can see the website at http://radioskyguide.org.

The code backend in JS is quite messy - this is one of my first times ever doing a project with JS/HTML/CSS, and my first time working with the library ```three.js```. As a result, different parts of the code are different in terms of efficiency and how well they follow "conventions" - the earliest parts being programmed by me as a beginner, with more recent parts (hopefully) being a bit more comprehensible. Backend refactoring and restructuring is something that I will keep in mind for the future, but this repo is really just a way to document my progress, rather than deploy the code. 

My next objective is to add user-uploaded objects to the catalog lists - this should greatly increase how useful this interface is.
